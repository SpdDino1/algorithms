Make a table where column is the sizes of cuts allowed. For example 1 , 2 ,3 ,4 ....
The row will be all possible rod lengths. 1,2,3,4 .....

So now you find profit of cutting every possible rod length with every possible cut. Sort of like knapsac. Fill up the table and extract max from right lower corner of matrix.
