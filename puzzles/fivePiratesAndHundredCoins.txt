>>Solution<<

Let's say the pirates were Cap, 1, 2,3,4 (Order of captains in that order)

If only 3,4 existed, 3 would become captain and propose to take all 100 coins and give none to 4. He votes for himself and claims majority.

If only 2,3,4 existed, 2 would become captain. He would give 1 coin to 4 and take 99 coins. He would tell 4 that if he did not vote for his plan, the above scenario would happend and he would go coinless. So with 2 and 4, he claims majority.

If only 1,2,3,4 existed, 1 would become captain. He would give 3 a coin and claim 99 coins. He would tell 3 that if he did not vote for him, the above scenario would happen and he would go coinless. So with 1 and 3 he claims the majority.

If Cap, 1, 2,3,4, Cap would give 1 coin to 2 and 1 coin to 4. He would tell them that if they didn't vote for him they would go coinless as in the above scenario. 

Hence cap can get 98 coins at max without risk
