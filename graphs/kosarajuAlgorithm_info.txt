>>Algorithm<<

>Start with a DFS on any arbitrary node [Mark visited nodes and maintain a dfs stack]. The moment you reach a node which has no more children, add it to a separate stack. If you finish your dfs and still have some unvisited nodes, arbitrarily start one from univisited.

>Once complete, reverse all edges.

>Start DFS from the node at the top of the stack. Keep track of all nodes being visited by this DFS. All those nodes fall under one strongly connected group. 
Now pick the next topmost element. If it has already been visited => Do nothing and simply pop off. Else start a DFS. This is the next strongly connected group
