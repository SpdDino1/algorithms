>>Detect whether a graph has a cycle<<

>Perform a DFS or BFS. You will know cycle exists if repeated element is found again in stack/queue

>>Check if a path exists between 2 nodes in a graph<<

>Take the source node as one of the nodes in the pair and start a DFS/BFS. If you reach the other node => some path exists
