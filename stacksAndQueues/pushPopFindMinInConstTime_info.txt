>>Algorithm

>Have a minElement int variable. 

>If you find an element being pushed that is < than minElement => minElement will be changed. 

		newMin - oldMin = elementToBePushed

Hence the element being pushed to stack is actually less than newMin and is not the original element. Store the newMin as minElement

>While popping, if the stack element being popped is less than minElement => This element had been mutated while pushing. Hence,

		oldMin = newMin - elementToBePushed

(or)	oldMin = currentMin - elementToBePopped

>So now your oldMin will be your minElement and you proceed
