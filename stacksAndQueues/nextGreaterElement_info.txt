Algorithm

>Have an array called nextGreaterElement that stores the next greatest element for every given index.

>Push first element to stack. 

>Let's say your current element is element 9. Check if element 9 is greater than the element on top of the stack. If yes, set nextGreatestElement[topOfStackIndex]=currentElement and pop it off. Keep iterating below unitl either topOfStack is greater or stack is empty. In that case push the current element to stack.

>If you reach the end of array, set nextGreatestElement of all stackIndexes remaining to -1

>>This approach is similar to stock span problem
