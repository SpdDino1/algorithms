>>Strategy<<

Let's say you are given an array of +ve numbers and are asked to find the number occuring odd number of times given that all other numbers occur even times.

By XORing all elements, the final answer will be the number appearing odd times.

XOR of any number even times ==0. So 1^2^3^1^2^3 =0 as all numbers appear even times. Use this trick to simplify problems!
