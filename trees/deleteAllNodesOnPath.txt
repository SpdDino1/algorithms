Problem

Remove all nodes which donâ€™t lie in any path with sum>= k

Algorithm

>Start from node and keep sending sum downward.
>If any leaf is encountered and the sum is <k =>delete leaf and return false

>Any node will first recursively call left child then right. If any one child returns true => That node is on some path with sum>k => don't
delete.
>If both children return false => That node is on no path with sum>k => Delete and return false
