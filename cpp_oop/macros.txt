>>Macros<<

They are the #define statements written to define some placeholders and their replacement text. They are also called 'Preprocessor Directives' as they are evaluated before compile time of the rest of the program.

You can use Macros as means to replace placeholders. But they can also handle conditional statements. So your code could have parts that get triggered (Compiled) only when a condition passes, else that code won't even be compiled!
