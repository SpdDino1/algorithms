>>Storage Classes<<

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_storage_classes.htm

A Storage class refers to the scope and life-span within a program.

>auto

It is the default storage class for all varialbes. It dies when the function it is defined within dies. Resides in RAM.

>register

It is similar to auto, except that the location of storage is a Register.

>static

It is stored in RAM and dies only when the whole program dies, not when the function it is declared in dies. Hence it has the largest life span when comapred to other storage classes.

If a static variable is declared within a function with a value of 2, but later on changes to 3. If the function dies and is called again, the variable stil holds the value 3 and doesn't start over from 2....as it is static and is actually declared only once.

static variables in classes are actually class variables as they are initialized only once and are shared by all objects.

>extern

This is a storage class used to point to a variable present in another c++ program file.

>mutable

This explicitly says that 'const' functions [Functions that aren't actually supposed to change any class data value] can change the data attribute bearing the 'mutable' keyword
