>>Function Overloading<<

It is the process of declaring numerous implementations of the same function, except that each declaration has different parameter types or counts or both. Each declaration can also have different return values.

Hence this supports the Polymorphism concept that OOP holds.

>>Function Overriding<<

It is the phenomenon where a derived class overrides the implementation of a function in its Base class and gives a new implementation instead.
