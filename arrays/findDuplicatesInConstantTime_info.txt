>This problem can be solved similar to finding the least positive number missing from array => Strategy used is to use elements in the array itself.

>Take an array of floats. Iterate i from 0 to size. For array[i], set array[array[i]] = array[array[i]] +0.1. 

>So now any element that occured twice => array[repeatingElement] will have fractional part as 0.2. Any element that occured singly will have array[singlyoccured] fractional part as 0.1. And any element that did not occur at all will have array[notOccurred] with no fractional part
