>>Algorithm<<

>Segregate all negative and positive numbers in the array. Bring all positive to right an dnegative to left. You may use a quicksort sort of pointer method to do this.

>Run through all positive numbers and turn the array[valueAtCurrentIndex] to negative. So if the current value is 2, set the number at array[2] to negative. 

>Once done, run through the array once again and the first index position carrying a positive value is the SMALLEST positive number missing from the sequence 1 to n.
