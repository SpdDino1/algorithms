>>Algorithm<<

>To trap rain in your current index, your current index should be bounded by 2 other indices with walls strictly greater than the current index.

>Construct 2 arrays. One to store the tallest wall on the left of every index and to the right of every index.

>Traverse the main array and for every element where largestLeft and largestRight != NULL, 
	 waterCollected = waterCollected + min(leftLargest[i],rightLargest[i]) - arr[i]
	 								   [ Select the min wall height - currentWallHeight ]

>Min wall height is required as this is the restricting condition. And if you already have a wall, water can only collect on top of it as your wall occupies some volume
