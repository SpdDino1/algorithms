>>Algorithm<<

>At each element of the array, you have the option to either include it or not. So have 2 vars called inclSum and exclSum. At index 0, have inclSum=arr[0] and exclSum=0

>At every array index after that, 
	temp=exclSum
	exclSum=max(exclsum,inclSum)
	inclSum=arr[i]+temp

	What you are doing here is,
		>If you include the currentIndex, you also ge the old index's exclSum. 
		>If you exclude the currentIndex, you get the old index's includeSum

		>Then you have to update the current exclSum by max(oldExclSum, oldInclSum)

>At the end choose max(exclSum,inclSum)
