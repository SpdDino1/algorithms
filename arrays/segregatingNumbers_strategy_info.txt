>>Algorithm<<

>We saw this as a subproblem when we had to find the least smallest missing number....we had to segregate negative to the right and positive to the left.

>Use a left and right pointer, similar to quicksort, and segregate. If right==even and left==odd, swap and left++, right--. Else if right==even and left ==even, left++.

>Here too you could first look out for 2's and (0,1)'s. Then you could go down and sort 0 and 1's with the same above algo
