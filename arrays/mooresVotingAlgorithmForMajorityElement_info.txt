>>Moore's Voting Algorithm<<


>Set target=arr[0] and count=1

>Iterate through the array. If index==target, count++. Else count--. 
If count ever becomes 0 at index i, change target to arr[i] and count=1

>The target remaining at the end of the iteration may or may not be the majority element. If it isn't => there is no majority element!

>>Proof of Working<<

>A majority element occurs >(n/2) times. So however you position the element [All majority element at the right or left or center], your count will be atleast 1 and target will be the majority element.
