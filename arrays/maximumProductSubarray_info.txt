>>Algorithm<<

>Here 0 acts as breaks in the array. So the array is naturally divided into ranges ended by zeroes.

>To compute the max product in a range, first compute the full product. If the product is +ve => This is the range's maximum. 
Else if the product is -ve => If we remove 1 negative number, we will get a positive, greater answer...but we don't know which negative number to remove. 
Hence we iterate through the range once again to find the smallest negative number. Then we divide our full range product with it to get the range's max product.

>Keep comparing range maximums with global vars
